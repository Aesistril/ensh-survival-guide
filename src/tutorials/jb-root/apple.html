        <h2>What are the cons?</h2>
        <p>
            Some banking apps can detect jailbreak and refuse to run.
            Besides that, downsides of jailbreaking is pretty rare. 
            If you run into issues you can easily(-ish) undo everyting 
            anyways.
        </p>
        <h2>Backup everyting before you start</h2>
        <p>
            Go to the settings and do a manual backup. Make sure to have a 
            up to date backup before you start because this process
            might include resetting your phone (Don't worry. iCloud 
            backups absolutely everything on your phone. You won't
            lose anything)
        </p>
        <h2>Is jailbreaking software trustworthy?</h2>
        <p>
            The cool hacker mode scrolling text might scare you
            but don't worry. Jailbreaking software mentioned in
            ios.cfw.guide is free and open source. 
            Meaning it's completely community-developed anyone 
            can look at what's inside it.

        <p>
            Avoid using anything that
            is not mentioned in the cfw.guide. If cfw.guide says
            it is not possible yet, then it's not possible yet and 
            you need to wait.

        <h2>The guide</h2>
        <b style="color: #FD5454;">
            Read everything very carefully and do what the guide says.
            Make sure the cables you are using are not damaged

            This guide is better than anything I can write but might 
            require some tech savviness. If you are unable to follow this,
             you can seek video guides by searching the model of your 
             device and the jailbreaking method recommended by this 
             guide on YouTube
