        <h2>What is DNS?</h2>
        <p>
            The Domain Name System (DNS), according to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">Cloudflare</a>,
            is the phone book of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            DNS is the system that takes easy to remember website names like "youtube.com" or "google.com" and
            converts them into a form that computers can understand (an IP address). When you type "youtube.com" into your web browser,
            your computer likely asks your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if they know who "youtube.com" is. If your ISP has
            a record for "youtube.com", they will reply with an IP address and your computer will ask Youtube
            (via their IP address) to send their website to your computer.
        </p>
        <h2>What does that have to do with blocking Ads?</h2>
        <p>
            Ads embedded within websites are usually served with addresses that need to be resolved with DNS!
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that if we can stop our computers from getting the IP addresses for the Ad servers,
            we can stop our computers from downloading ads in the first place! That means our goal is to
            set up a system that blocks DNS lookups for sites we don't want (Ad servers), while allowing
            lookups for sites we do want.

        <h3>What should I look for when choosing a public DNS server?</h3>
        <p>
            When choosing a publicly available DNS server to use, there's a few things to consider:
            <ul>
                <li>What region of the world is the server located relative to where you are?</li>
                <li>What content does the server block?</li>
                <li>Can you trust the server's host?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Why do these things matter?
        </p>
        <p>
            Every request to a new website has to go through the chosen DNS server to get
            resolved into an IP address. This means that you have to wait for the DNS
            response to come back from the DNS server before your computer can start loading
            the website you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            Normally, your ISP will handle DNS requests coming from devices
            on your network which would be local to you. However, when you change the default DNS
            server, you can end up choosing a server that can be far away. If your DNS server is
            located across the globe from you, the process of resolving requests will take longer
            than if your DNS server was local and can make browsing the web feel sluggish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your choice of DNS server can also affect what content is allowed and what content is blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, there are some DNS servers that explictly block adult content. This can be
            desirable if you have young kids at home and want to avoid mishaps with them accidentally
            being served this content or going to adult sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            This type of blocking could serve to be a problem though if you want to be able to navigate to
            adult content on your home network. Also, sometimes normal sites you use can be included in the
            server's "blocked" list. When using a public DNS server, you don't have the ability to granularly
            adjust what is available and what is blocked. This is a situation where hosting
            your own server may be desirable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, it is important to be able to trust your chosen DNS server due to privacy and
            security concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because your computer has to make a DNS request in order to get a website's IP address,
            your DNS server can track what websites you visit. Additionally, a malicious server
            could give you an incorrect website IP address that could unknowingly take you to
            malicious sites without your knowledge. While the risk of malicious DNS servers
            are lower when using reputable servers, the risk of DNS servers aggregating and selling
            your usage data is high.
