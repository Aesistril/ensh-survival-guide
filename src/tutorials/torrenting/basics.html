        <h2>What is BitTorrent </h2>

        <p>
            BitTorrent is a P2P (peer-to-peer) file-sharing protocol.
            "Protocol" in this context means "internet protocol", the
             procedure used for transmitting data over the internet (ex.
             HTTP, FTP, SMTP). However, most internet protocols are
             centralized, meaning there is a "server" that sends the
            data when the user requests a file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Peer-to-peer means there is no central server, instead,
            people who previously downloaded the files send them to people
             who want those files.
        </p>
        <p>
            BitTorrent is not just for piracy. It's a tool for sharing files.
             What purpose to use it depends on you.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Terminology </h2>
        <p><b>Seeder:</b> The person who sends the file</p>
        <p><b>Leecher:</b> The person who receives the file</p>
        <p><b>Peer:</b> A seeder or leecher. BitTorrent users.</p>
        <p><b>Tracker:</b> Coordination servers that keep track of who has 
            which file and who wants which file</p>
        
        <h2>Can I get in trouble for torrenting?</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone can see what you download including your internet
            service provider. 
            <a class="link-dotted-lgreen" href="https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com">iknowwhatyoudownload.com</a>
            shows what files you and people who had the same IP
            as you downloaded
        </p>
        
        <b>
            Service providers can send you a fine or a warning for downloading
            pirated content. Downloading illegal stuff like drug/bomb recipes
            will get you in trouble with authorities.
        </b>
        <p>
            Most countries just don't care though. In Turkey, I knew people
            who torrented copyrighted content without a VPN and didn't get
            any fines. And in some countries, it's straight up legal! You
            should look it up for your own country
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As long as you don't pirate anything you should be fine.
            However, it is always recommended to use a VPN while torrenting.
            <b style="color: #FD5454;">
                You should bind your VPN to your torrent client if you
                don't want people to see what you download
            </b>

        <h2>Torrent Clients</h2>
        <p>
            Torrent client is the software that allows people to 
            communicate using the BitTorrent protocol. Much like how 
            a Web Browser will enable you to communicate using the HTTP 
            protocol
        </p>
        
        <p>Desktop (Windows, MacOS, Linux, BSD...) - üíª </p>
        <p>iOS/iPadOS - üçé </p>
        <p>Android - ü§ñ </p>
        
        <b>Popular torrent clients</b>
        <ul>
            <li>- qBittorrent üíª </li>
            <li>- Deluge üíª (complicated VPN binding)</li>
            <li>- Transmission üíª (no VPN binding support)</li>
            <li>- LibreTorrent ü§ñ (no VPN binding support)</li>
            <li>- BiglyBT ü§ñ üíª </li>
            <li>- iTransmission üçé (requires sideloading or jailbreak)</li>
            <li>- iTorrent üçé (requires sideloading or jailbreak)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            All these clients are open source. Avoid using proprietary
            BitTorrent clients.
        </p>

        <p>
            My choice is qBittorrent on desktop and BiglyBT on mobile. You
            can start your torrent client after downloading it.
        </p>

        <h2>Recommended VPNs</h2>
        <p>
            I recommend Mullvad (paid) or RiseUp VPN (free) both of them
            are extremely trustworthy and run by poeple who 
            won't snitch on you
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="vpn-binding">How to bind your VPN</h2>
        <p>
            After this process, your torrent client will refuse to make
            any connections if your VPN is not connected or when your VPN
            gets disconnected. This process is different for every client
            and I'll only be explaining some of them. Search on Google if
            your client is not included

        <b>qBittorrent <a class="link-dotted-lgreen" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNTorrents/comments/ssy8vv/guide_bind_vpn_network_interface_to_torrent/">source</a></b>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to Preferences, and then Advanced tab.</li>
            <li>Check for the differences on the "Network Interface" list when you connect/disconnect the VPN (you may have to restart qBittorrent for the list to refresh).</li>
            <li>Select the one that shows up/disappears from the previous test.</li>
            <li>Restart qBittorrent.</li>

        <b>BiglyBT (Android) <a class="link-dotted-lgreen" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNTorrents/comments/ppmnax/howto_safely_torrent_on_android_with_biglybt/">source</a></b>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect to the VPN</li>
            <li>Go to BiglyBT Settings, Scroll down, and go to "Full Settings > Mode"</li>
            <li>Under Mode, select "Advanced" to show all settings, go back</li>
            <li>Connection > Advanced Network Settings</li>
            <li>Look at the gray text under "Bind to local IP address or interface". These are the available network adapters/IPs. Only when your VPN is enabled will you see its additional interfaces. In my case, it is "tun0". It should always be something like tun<number></li>
            <li><b style="color: #FD5454;">YOU MUST DO THIS TOO:</b> Scroll down, enable "Check bind ... on startup" and "Enforce IP bindings ..." and "Pause downloads on loss on binding"  (this last one is mostly optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Deluge</b>

            Binding on deluge is a little complicated but I'm gonna

        <h2>What are .torrent files</h2>
        <p>
            You can think of them as a link to the file you want to download.
             A torrent file contains the data you'll need for the files to
             be downloaded, such as file names, sizes, and structure, as
             well as the servers you can contact to request a list of peers
             to connect to.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Where do I find .torrent files</h2>
        <p>
            You can find "Torrent Trackers" on Google and search for files
            on these websites. But using a metasearch engine (a search engine
            that searches every website you add) will be a better experience.
            Check out our [Advanced Search/Metasearch Guide]
        </p>
        
        <h2>Seeding</h2>
        <p>
            You should be encouraged to leave the torrent in the "seeding"
            state for a while after the download is completed. Remember, in
            BitTorrent people download files from other people's computers.
            By seeding, you are sharing the file you just downloaded with
            the others.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Downloading apps blindly can be dangerous</h2>
        <p>
            Don't run .exe files disguised as movies. If you are downloading
            an app, only download apps from trustworthy "distributors".
            Look for online posts about a distributor before downloading
            their torrents
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For example a torrent could be named
            Fun.Game.3.MULTi13-ElAesistril. In this case you should search
            "Is ElAesistril trustworthy?" before downloading and running it.
            You should seek real people's comments which is mostly on
            reddit and other forums
